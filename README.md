## ‚ùì Why?

As a developer, it's important to showcase your expertise in different technologies to potential collaborators and employers. With **github-readme-tech-stack**, you can easily create a visual representation of the technologies used in your GitHub repository and include it in your **profile README**. This can help you stand out and attract the attention of others who are looking for developers with specific skill sets.

The images are fully customizable, so you can choose the technologies you want to showcase and even adjust the colors, icons, and the alignment to match your personal brand.

Personally, I've always wanted to show off my skills in a clean and modern way. I could do that with just the badges, but they didn't match the style of [github-readme-streak-stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats) and [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). With **github-readme-tech-stack**, that's no longer a problem, it naturally matches those cards!
